... you know .... maybe i'm too old for this ...

lately, I've been having these thoughts that if every other page of the book annoys me and that happens in many books of the same genre, then maybe i've outgrown the genre. But you know what? I will not give up because the genre can't do anything against bad writing and bad editing. And if I am , in fact, too old for this, then the younger generation and the readers after me deserve to not be treated as complete idiots... they also deserve to read something meaningful ... they gave you their money AND time to read your book - the least you can do, is give them something meaningful.

So, at  this point, I am finishing my initial rant and start with the book ....

You know, I have flashbackt to ACOTAR, the first book was very cringe, but after that she found out how to write and got a lot better. I really hope that's the case for Adalyn Grace. Let's start at the very beginning. 

I am commenting this as I am reading so don't worry, maybe I will answer my own questions later in the comment...

-------------SPOILERS----------------

Meet Signa. Her parents throw a party for her birth and everyone is poisoned at the party and die, except Sigma, the 2-month old baby. The baby can sense the Death and the Spirits. The Death (seen as a mixture of a person and shadows) sees her and can't take her, although she is also poisoned and is fascinated that the baby can't die. 

Fast forward a couple of years, Signa has lived up until that point with her grandmother, who dies, other caregivers, who die, and at the ripe age of 19, with her Aunt Magda, who hates her but wants Signa's money. Signa will get her money when she turns 20 (it was said that it saw a significant sum). Aunt Magda is obviously tormenting her (throwing a cup of tea against her)... my first question is - um, Signa, girl, you are 19. I don't now - get a job, go clean something, get money, find friends... You are not 12, you don't have to act like a damsel in distress, you can see the Death and the Spirits, girl, this is a gold mine, go join a circus, predict the future for rich wives, idk, make a millionaire of your own, don't wait for daddy's money while Aunt Magda is throwing cups of tea at you. 

While we are at that point, who is giving the money? Who is managing the estate and so on for Signa? Why was she removed from her home? You know, with so much money, you could have hired 1000 nannies to look after her AT HOME. You know, these kinds of details from the abundant life are very important to make a story believable. Your readers may be 14-25 but they all know the world, they think about these things...

Nevermind, we continue. 

Signa eats belladonna berries to die and see the Death again to tell him to stop tormenting her (at that point, she has seen the Death 2 more times, when she was 5 and 10, i didn't understand how is the Death's fault that our girl Signa is lazy but nevertheless, she wants to call him and tell him to leave her alone because apparently everyone thinks she is a witch repsonsible for the death of all her caregivers)

The Death comes and THE FIRST sentence this paranormal creature says to the probably only girl who can see him/her is "I'd prefer you not summon me whenever the urge strikes"... you know, i understand the commedy effect, I want it even, but oh my lord, keep the mystery for at least 5 more pages - this was directly at page 12. And the nect "I am busy man, you know" - so he is a man after all. *sign*  We, girlies, can't escape men even in the afterlife. Well, that's unfortunate. 

Her answer is "If your intern is to ruin my life, it's time to tell me why" .... *cue the annoyed boy gif* .. Signa, girl, you haven't seen him for 9 years, you don't work, you don't study, you even don't cook or clean, he can't help you with that ... and then, OF COURSE, she hears A DISBELIEF in the DEATH's voice. How do you hear emotions in the Death's voice. Isn't he like, i don't know, a supernatural creature. 

He says her name, she doesn't like it, he answers "Your name is no curse, Little Bird. I just like the taste of it." *sign^5* This sentence is on the back of the book. So apparently, the Death will get some kind of a love interest. Which is very concerning to me at that point, because you know, he is very, very old probably, and he saw her as a baby, he saw her as a 5-years old kid, as a 10-years old ... you know, I am all for a good age-difference relationship, but that feel little creepy to me...

And of course, next sentence "It was strange, the things his laughter did to her" ???? What??? Creeped her out. Obviously, not that is meant by this, but at that point I would be like - you know what, i have a sock drawer to sort out, i'm out.

THEN, my dear friends, SHE TRIES TO STAB HIM. STAB. HIM. THE DEATH. WITH A KITCHEN KNIFE. You know, in all of these 19 years solitude you could have gone to a library, read a newspaper, a flyer i don't know. But to be this oblivious and stupid at 19 YEARS OLD is criminal. At that point, I'm with Aunt Magda on the throwing the cup at that girl, I want to do it as well. Was this supposed to be a ***SPILER FOR SHATTER ME BOOK SERIES, DON'T READ IF YOU HAVENT READ IT AND YOU WANT TO***** Juliet shoots Warner and runs away kind of thing??? god i miss the feeling the first 3 books of the shatter me series gave me... when everything was nicely written *****

So of course, he laughs, she is like oh my god how did he not die, then Aunt Magda comes, she starts to twist for whatever reason Signa's hair, Signa touches her, Magda dies, Signa start to hyperventilate and say that it's the Death's fault ... girl .... lie .... you touched her ... you called the Death ... don't play the victim here ...

I must say, his sentence "Well, that's one to shut her up" actually wa funny. This was a nice moment for that. I smiled a little bit. Thank you, Adalyn. It's been a rough week.

And of course, Signa, as the big innocent victim she is, says "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?" and he is like, i haven't done anything?????? (which i understand) I thought at that point that the Death doen't kill them, he only comes for the spirits, why would he kill them?

Signa gives a short rant how the Death ruins her life, adding like "You are the reason i'm miserable" ... girl, don't just throw this blame at anyone, take some responsibilty. 

AND MY FAVOURITE PART GUYS MA FAVOURITE PARY - "No one will ever want to marry me"..... I had to take a moment away from the book. Imagine, you are a 19-years old heiress to a fortune, everyone wants to be your caregiver at the cripe age of 19 because of your money, somehow everyone dies but somehow you always find people. You don't have family, you don't have friends, for some reason, you don't have access to your vast fortune, you don't have a home anymore because you just killed your aunt, THE DEATH IS IN FRONT OF YOU, and your first thought is that no one will ever marry you. I mean ... in other books, this line of thinking would have been used to underline how stupid or shallow the other girl who is also interested in the main love interest is or the evil stepsister. But nooooo, no our Signa, she is shallow and she is not afraid to show it! 

And the Death, as the practical guy he is, is also wondering like me what she is talking about. He tells her to wait for him for 2 days. He REACHES for her (i thoug he is a shadow)

She does. She waits. But he doesn't take the Magda's spirit.... And for some reason, there are ever tax arrangmenets when you die ... *sign* well, i guess i can't be anything I want when I die, dammit. So Magda's spirit can't leave the land she dies - i am curious how this works, like are there invisible lines she can't cross or is it like a Stefan Salvatore's things - you only have to be invited... Or do you go to the town municipality and the ghost ask for the paper where tha land is and stays there ...

Nevertheless, poor Magda is killed just like that and Signa's "new mantra" is that "it's his fault" and "she hates him more than ever". Why? Who knows. Then, Signa kils a hatchling, just like that, kills herself AGAIN, the DEATH is there AGAIN, although he explicitly told her to wait for him, and then, he AGAIN doesn't tak away Magda's spirit.... That is on page 21, guys, this is just page 21...

Then, while Signa and her dead Aunt Magda's spirit peacefully co-habit in the house, a new carriage come to take our girl away - the MR. Elijah Hawthorne who is apparently the Magda's granddaughter Lillian's husband. The carriage comes, our Signa "tremmbles like a hummingbird" with her "bony wrists and scrawny legs". ACOTAR reference .... And still, after the deaths, after the misery, after the hunger, our Signa's only thought are to be a part of the high society. You know, Signa, i applaud you for dreaming in times like this. I would have thought if this unknown mister here to take me will lock me up and use me as a slave, but you do you, Signa, who am I to judge...

You know who am I? I paid money for this book, so I WILL judge, so let me continue. 

So, of course, in the carriage there is a handsome unknown boy "in his early twenties", who is seeminly annoyed by her, although she Is So NiCe To OfFeR tEe AnD wAtEr FoR tHe HoRsEs .... a boy, whose ""fingers had stilled on the pages" of his newspaper. You know, Adalyn, you don't have to tell us exactly how they are feeling and how they are exactly reacting. SHOW US. If you are following Signa's point of view, tell us what she is seeing, not what she is not seeing. Otherwise, what is the point? 

They go to the train station where she sees many people and she is impressed by this - you know, she earlier said that her Aunt Magda has spent her days in the gaming halls (still not a good reason to kill her but ok). In this time, Signa would have been alone. What was she doing all the time? Not reading obviously. But what? Not being with people, not even going to the train station, not having any friends... No wonder she is little stupid. 

"An older gentlemen with a proud chest escorted a grinning woman who couldn't stop staring down at the ring on her finger. [...] Signa filled out their story in her head, imagining that they were newly married [...] She envisioned all the beautiful gowns [...]" Was this some kind of Harry Potter comes to the station and can't stop staring at the people and later sees the chocolate frogs for the first time type of thing? And Signa, sweety, you are not exactly Shakespeare, every single person would have thought that they are newlywed. The other possibility would have been if the young miss had stolen the ring and is admiring her good thief's sense. Signa, get a hold of yourself. 

A boy helps Signa with her luggage and is breathy afterwards... you would think that if Signa has "scrawny legs" after ears of hunger, she wowuld not have so much to carry except her innocence but you never know, maybe she took Magda's tea cups....

You know, I miss the setion in Wattpad where you can comment on every line, because that is exactly what I want to do in this book. 

"Though Sylas perpetually looked like someone who'd swalloed a sour tart [...]" - well, I would too if i travelled across the country to pick a scrawny stupid girl who killed her aunt and is thinking only about marriage.

"[...] and not get separated from the devil that was Sylas Throly" - oh my god Signa, you are such a Karen ... what is the Sylas's fault now? It this a reference that Sylas is the devil in fact? I am tired.

Adalyn, please read "Clockwork Angel" by Cassandra Clare. The beginning is almost the same, in the same historical theme, but written way better. Take notes, be better, don't waste my time.
